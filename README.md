# Password-Generator
##As a coder:
I want; a script that can generate a random password

##Usage:
When the user clicks generate password,
They will be prompted how long will the password be, with warnings if the password is too short or too long.
If they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
Then a random password will be given to them.
